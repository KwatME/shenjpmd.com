John Paul Shen, MD, is a physician-scientist with a scientific background in chemical biology and cancer genomics and is board-certified in Internal Medicine, Hematology, and Oncology. Currently holding the title of Assistant Professor (tenure-track) at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer, Dr Shen runs a basic science lab focused on the genomics of colon and appendix cancer. Dr. Shen is also licensed to practice medicine in both California and Texas and is board certified in Internal Medicine, Hematology, and Medical Oncology, with a particular expertise in treating patients with tumors of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. His research is focused on the application of both experimental and computational systems biology techniques, in particular genetic interaction networks, to investigate cancer biology. The ultimate goal of this work is to translate new knowledge of the cancer cell into improved outcomes in clinical oncology. In particular, Dr. Shen is working to personalize chemotherapy selection, meaning to match a patient’s chemotherapy to the specific mutations found in their unique tumor.

Dr. Shen pursued his undergraduate education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) with a major in Chemistry and minor in Political Science. He returned to Saint Louis University High School for the 2002-2003 academic year to teach physics and geometry as part of the Alumni Service Corp, also coaching the St. Louis Druids rugby team and helping to found the SLUH robotics team. After receiving his medical degree from Washington University in 2008 Dr. Shen matched to UCSD where he completed his residency in Internal Medicine and fellowship in Hematology & Oncology. At UCSD Shen joined the lab of Trey Ideker lab, and internationally recognized leader in network and systems biology.

Dr. Shen’s work has been published in leading journals including Cell, Nature Genetics, Nature Methods, and the Journal of the American Chemical Society, and was also featured in the San Diego Union Tribune (http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/biotech/sd-me-cancer-crispr-20170322-story.html). His research has been funded by the National Institute of Health, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the Marsha Rivkin Center for Ovarian Cancer research as well as the Tower Cancer Foundation, and he has received numerous awards including ASCO’s Young Investigator Award and selection as one of the American Association of Cancer Research’s NextGen Stars.
